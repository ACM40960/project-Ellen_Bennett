## Introduction

   The aim of this project is to estimate Pi using a variety of techniques with the ultimate goal of finding an optimal method. In total, nine different methods were trialed, eight of which involved Monte Carlo Simulation. Four of these methods were simulated using **Wolfram Mathematica 13.0**, while the rest were performed in **R**.
   
   Here is an example of one of the Monte Carlo methods:

## Installation Instructions
### Mathematica Notebook

The Mathematica notebook *Estmating_Pi.nb* contains four different simulations that estimate Pi. These are:
1. Archimedes' Method
2. Quadrant Method
3. Gamma Function Integral
4. Gregory-Leibniz Series.

The notebook was created using **Wolfram Mathematica 13.0**, which can be installed by following these [**instructions**](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/InstallingMathematica.html).

The notebook can be downloaded by going to this [**webpage**](https://github.com/ACM40960/project-Adye-Curran/blob/main/Estimating_Pi.nb) and clicking the download button on the right hand side.

Once the notebook has been downloaded it can be opened on your computer by running the *Wolfram Mathematica* program, and clicking the ***Open...*** icon.

The notebook is divided into seven sections, each of which is split into various subsections. Sections can be expanded by clicking on the orange arrow icon at the right hand side of the section title. The first four sections contain code pertaining to their relevant simulation method, and the last three contain code that was used to obtain plots included in the *LaTeX* document.

It is advised not to run the entire notebook due to its run time, and instead to consult this [**guide**](https://github.com/ACM40960/project-Adye-Curran#mathematica-1).
